# Critters!
Its a canvas like thing, except made with html.

First, to get started, you import the script:

<code><script src="https://2kinc.me/critters/index.js"></script></code>

Then you make a world:

<code>var world = new world()</code>

To make a critter, you use <code>new world.critter()</code>.

And a rectangle: <code>new world.rect()</code>.
